# WoniuNote Code Quality Guide

This document outlines the code quality standards and improvements implemented for the WoniuNote project. It provides guidelines for maintaining and extending the codebase with consistent quality.

## Code Structure Improvements

### 1. Decorator Pattern

We've implemented the decorator pattern for common cross-cutting concerns:

```python
# Login check decorator
@login_required
def some_function():
    # Function only executes if user is logged in
    pass

# Database error handling decorator
@db_error_handler
def database_operation():
    # Database operations with consistent error handling
    pass
```

### 2. Function Decomposition

Large, complex functions have been decomposed into smaller, more manageable helper functions:

- Main functions focus on the high-level flow and delegate to helper functions
- Helper functions are prefixed with underscore (_) to indicate they are private
- Each function has a specific responsibility

## Documentation Standards

### 1. Function Documentation

All functions should include a docstring that follows this pattern:

```python
def function_name(param1, param2):
    """Short description of what the function does.
    
    More detailed explanation if necessary.
    
    Args:
        param1 (type): Description of param1
        param2 (type): Description of param2
        
    Returns:
        type: Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ExceptionType: When and why this exception might be raised
    """
    # Function implementation
```

### 2. Module Documentation

Each module should have a docstring at the top explaining its purpose and responsibilities.

## Error Handling

### 1. Database Operations

All database operations should be wrapped in try-except blocks or use the `@db_error_handler` decorator:

```python
try:
    db.session.add(item)
    db.session.commit()
except Exception as e:
    db.session.rollback()
    logger.error(f"Database error: {str(e)}")
    # Handle the error appropriately
```

### 2. Input Validation

Always validate input before processing:

```python
if not name or name.strip() == "":
    return jsonify({"error": "Name cannot be empty"}), 400
```

## Logging Standards

### 1. Log Levels

- `logger.debug()`: Detailed information for debugging
- `logger.info()`: Confirmation that things are working as expected
- `logger.warning()`: Something unexpected happened but the application can continue
- `logger.error()`: A more serious error that prevented a function from executing
- `logger.critical()`: A very serious error that might prevent the application from continuing

### 2. Log Context

Include relevant context in log messages:

```python
logger.info(f"User {user_id} accessed {resource_name}")
```

## Testing Framework

### 1. Test Structure

Tests are organized by functionality in the `tests/functional/` directory.

### 2. Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

To run specific card functionality tests:

```bash
python tests/run_card_tests.py
```

### 3. Test Fixtures

Reusable test fixtures are defined to set up test data and clean up afterward:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def setup_test_data():
    # Set up test data
    yield data
    # Clean up test data
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Database Query Optimization

- Avoid unnecessary queries
- Use appropriate indexes
- Filter data at the database level, not in Python code

### 2. Response Time

- Removed unnecessary `time.sleep()` calls
- Implemented proper error handling to avoid hanging requests

## Code Review Checklist

Before submitting code for review, ensure:

1. All functions have appropriate docstrings
2. Proper error handling is implemented
3. Logging is used appropriately
4. Tests cover the new functionality
5. No debug print statements remain in the code
6. No commented-out code remains unless it serves a specific purpose

## Next Steps for Improvement

1. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
2. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
3. Consider implementing a more robust API structure
4. Review and optimize database queries further
